# IBM_Machine_learning_Recommender_Systems

This repository contains materials for the Machine Learning Capstone course offered by IBM.

About this Course
The Machine Learning Capstone course leverages various Python-based machine learning libraries, including Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras. It serves as a culmination of your machine learning journey, allowing you to apply and demonstrate your proficiency in the field.

Before enrolling in this course, it is essential to complete all preceding courses within the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate program.

Throughout this capstone, participants will:

Build a course recommender system
Analyze course-related datasets
Calculate cosine similarity and create a similarity matrix
Generate recommendation systems using techniques such as KNN, PCA, and non-negative matrix collaborative filtering
Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to share their work with peers for evaluation, fostering a collaborative learning experience.
